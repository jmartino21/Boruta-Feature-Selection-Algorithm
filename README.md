# Boruta-Feature-Selection-Algorithm
This project investigates the impact of feature selection on the performance of three machine learning models: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The goal is to analyze model accuracy before and after applying the Boruta feature selection algorithm.
